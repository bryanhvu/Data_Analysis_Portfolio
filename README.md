# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hello, my name is Bryan! I am a Data Analyst with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computational Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin. After spending 2 years working as a research engineer for the Engineer Research and Development Center, I decided to pursue my passion for Data Analysis and am currently seeking a role in this field.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and a platform to share my projects and track my progress in Data Analytics topics. From data cleaning and exploration to visualization and statistical analysis, I am passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and decision-making.

Please feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me with any questions or opportunities to collaborate. Thank you for visiting!

## Projects

### Analyzing the Box Office

Code: [`analyzing_the_box_office.ipynb`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/503dbd00bf1ca2220302f5a3af8b711f188687be/Python%20Projects/Analyzing%20the%20Box%20Office/analyzing_the_box_office.ipynb)

Description: This project analyzes movie budget and revenue data, scraped from The Numbers [website](https://www.the-numbers.com/), to determine if higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office. The goal is to understand whether movie studios should invest more money in their films to generate more revenue.

Skills: webscraping, data visualization, linear regression, data cleaning

Technology: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Results:

### Boston Housing Price Model

Code: [`boston_housing_price_model`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/503dbd00bf1ca2220302f5a3af8b711f188687be/Python%20Projects/Boston%20Housing%20Price%20Model/Boston_Housing_Price_Model.ipynb)

Description: The aim of this project is to develop a model for estimating the prices of residential properties in Boston based on their characteristics. The project involves analyzing and exploring the Boston house price dataset, splitting it for training and testing, running a multivariable regression, evaluating the model's coefficients and residuals, and using data transformation techniques to improve the model's performance. Ultimately, the goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate the price of a property based on its characteristics.

Skills: multivariable regression, data exploration, data training and testing, evaluating and interpretting a regression model, data transformation, data cleaning, data visualization

Technology: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, Plotly

Results:

### Data Detective: Rediscovering the Power of Handwashing

Code: [`handwashing_discovery.ipynb`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/503dbd00bf1ca2220302f5a3af8b711f188687be/Python%20Projects/The%20Power%20of%20Handwashing/Handwashing_Discovery.ipynb)

Description: In the 1800s, people attributed illnesses to "bad air" or evil spirits due to their lack of understanding. Dr Semmelweis was a medical professional who noticed that many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever, and he suspected that the procedures at Vienna General Hospital were flawed. The aim of this project is to explore Dr Semmelweis' data and make a compelling argument using it. 

Skills: t-test, stastical analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, making data-driven arguments

Technology: Python, Pandas, sklearn, scipy, numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn

Results:

### Google Play Store Analysis

Code: [`google_play_store_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/503dbd00bf1ca2220302f5a3af8b711f188687be/Python%20Projects/Google%20Play%20Store%20Analysis/google_play_store_analysis.ipynb)

Description: This project involves comparing thousands of apps in the Google Play Store to gain insights into different app categories, their competitiveness, and opportunities based on popularity. It also involves analyzing data to determine the impact of making an app paid versus free, determining the reasonable cost for a paid app, identifying the paid apps with the highest revenue, and evaluating how many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on sales revenue.

Skills: data exploration, data cleaning, data visualization, data wrangling

Technology: Python, Pandas, Plotly

Results:
### Bike Sales Analysis and Dashboard in Excel
**File:** [`bike_sales.xlsx`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/82747950b9bc205d8a3074d97989d004b9af4b5d/Excel%20Projects/Bike%20Sales/Bike_Sales.xlsx)

**Description:** This project involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset on Bike Sales and creating a dashboard. The dataset includes information on customer demographics such as marital status, car ownership, commute distance, age and whether or not they have purchased a bike. By analyzing the data, we can extract meaningful insights that can aid in our understanding of the bike sales process and help us make informed business decisions.

**Skills:** VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Power Pivot, CUBE Formulas, Charts, Building Dashboard, Data Cleaning, Flow Control

**Technology:** Excel

**Results:** A cleaned excel spreadsheet with several constructed pivot tables and a filterable dashboard observing key metrics for the bike sale process.

### Cleaning Nashville Housing Data with SQL
**Code:** [`nashville_housing_data_cleaning.sql`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Projects/Nashville%20Housing%20Project/nashville_housing_data_cleaning.sql)

**Description:** The Nashville housing dataset contains information about various housing properties in Nashville, Tennessee. The data has been collected from various sources and is not consistent in terms of format and quality. The objective of this project is to clean the data, making it more consistent and useable. 

**Skills:** data type conversions, populating empty data fields using inner joins, splitting string columns, data modification, removing duplicates, deleting unused columns

**Technology:** SQL

**Results:** A cleaner dataset ready for future analysis.


### Coronavirus Data Exploration and Visualization
**Code:** [`covid_data_exploration.sql`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/cd6b727c307bcce307b039535961643f20e03e8f/SQL%20Projects/Coronavirus%20Data%202023/covid_data_exploration.sql)

**Presentation:**

**Description:** The Coronavirus pandemic has been one of the most significant events of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide. The objective of this project is to explore the Coronavirus deaths data from the Our World in Data [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) taken on April 25th, 2023, and extract meaningful insights. 


**Skills:** joins, temp tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and converting data
