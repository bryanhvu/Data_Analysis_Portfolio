### Bike Sales Analysis and Dashboard in Excel
**File:** [`Bike_Sales.xlsx`](https://github.com/bryanhvu/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/82747950b9bc205d8a3074d97989d004b9af4b5d/Excel%20Projects/Bike%20Sales/Bike_Sales.xlsx)

**Description:** This project involves cleaning and analyzing a dataset on Bike Sales and creating a dashboard. The dataset includes information on customer demographics such as marital status, car ownership, commute distance, age and whether or not they have purchased a bike. By analyzing the data, we can extract meaningful insights that can aid in our understanding of the bike sales process and help us make informed business decisions.

**Skills:** VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Power Pivot, CUBE Formulas, Charts, Building Dashboard, Data Cleaning, Flow Control

**Technology:** Excel

**Results:** A cleaned excel spreadsheet with several constructed pivot tables and a filterable dashboard observing key metrics for the bike sale process.
