## About

This project involves comparing thousands of apps in the Google Play Store to gain insights into different app categories, their competitiveness, and opportunities based on popularity. It also involves analyzing data to determine the impact of making an app paid versus free, determining the reasonable cost for a paid app, identifying the paid apps with the highest revenue, and evaluating how many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on sales revenue.
