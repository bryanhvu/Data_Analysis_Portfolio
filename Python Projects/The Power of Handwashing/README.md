In the 1800s, people attributed illnesses to "bad air" or evil spirits due to their lack of understanding. Dr Semmelweis was a medical professional who noticed that many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever, and he suspected that the procedures at Vienna General Hospital were flawed. The aim of this project is to explore Dr Semmelweis' data and make a compelling argument using it.
